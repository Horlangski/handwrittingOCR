# Handwriting-OCR

## kNN OCR

run `python kNN_OCR.py` to test its accuracy against digits.png. For testing with different images change img source path and adjust size and number of cells in image.

## SVM OCR

run `python SVM_OCR.py` to test its accuracy against digits.png.  For testing with different images change img source path and adjust size and number of cells in image.

## SVM OCR using MNST Dataset

run `python generateClassifier.py` followed by `python performRecognition.py`.
The following images can be used for testing by changing the image source path in the code:
- photo_1.jpg
- photo_2.jpg
- photo_3.jpg
